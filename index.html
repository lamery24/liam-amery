            <p>Welcome to my personal website. I am a graduate environmental engineering student with a deep interest in water resources and environmental engineering, environmental health, and natural resources. 
                I am looking apply my strong academic background, technical skills, and hands-on experience to engage in impactful research and practical applications related to drinking water systems, environmental health, and sustainable engineering practices. 
                I am passionate about community-based engineering to improve access to safe and available drinking water.</p>

                        <p></p><p2>Read our recently published article! For more information read the abstract below, reference the Lead in Drinking Water in Massachusetts Schools and Childcare Centers project above, or check out the full text link.</p2>

                        <p2>Exposure to lead through drinking water is of concern for children, particularly at schools and early education and care facilities (EECFs), where they spend much of their time. We use lead and copper data from monitoring in schools and EECFs in Massachusetts (USA) and create risk indices based on the percentage of fixtures in a school above three water lead level (WLL) thresholds (15, 5, and 1 ppb) to model which building characteristics, water source, and water treatment practices are associated with a school exceeding these thresholds. Local building characteristics had larger effects than information about the public water supplier (PWS), and buildings built from 1950 to 1980 were most at risk. Daily flushing and fixture replacement often decreased elevated WLLs, and water coolers had lower WLLs than other fixtures. These findings highlight the value of WLL monitoring programs and can be used to prioritize future investment in monitoring and remediation.</p2>

            <h3><a href="https://www.umass.edu/magazine/fall-2022/why">Taking on the Tundra</a>- an article in UMass Magazine</h3>
                        <p></p><p2>In the summer of 2021, six civil and environmental engineering undergrads left the comforts of campus and set off for the Alaskan wilderness. Their task: to study beaded streams, a natural phenomenon unique to the Arctic tundra. The expedition is part of the Integrating Geosciences and Engineering in the Arctic (IGEA) program run by Professor Colin Gleason, who designed the one-year course specifically to challenge students by exposing them to the rigors of real-world field research.</p2>

                        <p2>Liam Amery ’22 says, “I think that the most valuable learning moments came when things did not go to plan.” For example, “our original field measurement plan took much longer than we had anticipated, so we had to adapt on the fly.”</p2>
