                <h3>Lead in Drinking Water in Massachusetts Schools and Childcare Centers</h3>
                <p></p>
                <p>A statewide program in Massachusetts, facilitated by The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) and named the Assistance Program for Lead in School Drinking Water, began in 2016 to encourage public schools and EECFs to test their drinking water for lead and copper contamination. The program ran in 2016–2017 and again in 2017–2018. In January 2020, MassDEP initiated the ongoing expanded assistance program (EAP), which is focused on EECFs, adds private facilities, and assesses lead only. These programs helped schools sample water at all fixtures in the building used for drinking or food preparation.
                Since 2021 I have been analyzing results associcated to the program, and in 2022 I joined the project team where I help with program logistics, as well as continued research and scientific communication. Highlights of my work within the program are listed below:</p>

            <h3>Engineers Without Borders</h3>
                <p></p>
                <p>In my freshman year at UMass I became involved with the UMass Amherst Chapter of Engineers Without Borders (EWB). EWB USA is an organization partnering with communities around the world to meet their basic human needs and at UMass we have projects based in Kenya, Ghana, and locally.
                In my time with EWB-UMass, I was mostly involved with the Kenya project where we worked with Nguluni, Kenya to implement rainwater catchment systems, handwashing stations, and expand their distribution system. As one of the project managers
                from 2021-2022 I helped facilitate weekly meetings with our members, oversaw a remote monitoring trip thanks to a partnership with students from the University of Nairobi, and submitted technical reports to EWB-USA. I am very
                grateful for the experiences I had and all of the amazing people that I met during my four years with EWB-UMass. You can find out more about the projects or donate to the UMass chapter <a href="https://ewbumass.weebly.com/">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>Integrating Geosciences and Engineering in the Arctic</h3>
<p></p>
                <p><a href="https://blogs.umass.edu/igea/">Integrating Geosciences and Engineering in the Arctic </a> (IGEA) is a course designed and advised by Dr. Colin Gleason at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. It was a two semester long (spring and fall) course designed for undergraduate students in the College of Engineering and the Department of Geosciences to prepare and send students to conduct research in the Arctic. 
                I was invloved with IGEA during my junior-senior years at UMass, working within a team of six undergraduates to research <a href="https://blogs.umass.edu/igea/beaded-stream-background/"> beaded streams </a>, hydrological features unique to permafrost regions. We constructed a research plan during the spring,
                spent several weeks in the Alaskan North Slope over the summer, and analyzed all our data, wrote a report, and presented our results in the fall. For me, it was one of my first experiences conducting research and an amazing learning experiennce as I describe <a href="https://www.umass.edu/engineering/news/igea-arctic-expedition"> here.</a> Some of my roles and accomplishments are listed below</p>

                        <p2>Exposure to lead through drinking water is of concern for children, particularly at schools and early education and care facilities (EECFs), where they spend much of their time. We use lead and copper data from monitoring in schools and EECFs in Massachusetts (USA) and create risk indices based on the percentage of fixtures in a school above three water lead level (WLL) thresholds (15, 5, and 1 ppb) to model which building characteristics, water source, and water treatment practices are associated with a school exceeding these thresholds. Local building characteristics had larger effects than information about the public water supplier (PWS), and buildings built from 1950 to 1980 were most at risk. Daily flushing and fixture replacement often decreased elevated WLLs, and water coolers had lower WLLs than other fixtures. These findings highlight the value of WLL monitoring programs and can be used to prioritize future investment in monitoring and remediation.</p2>

            <h3><a href="https://www.umass.edu/magazine/fall-2022/why">Taking on the Tundra</a>- an article in UMass Magazine</h3>
                        <p></p><p2>In the summer of 2021, six civil and environmental engineering undergrads left the comforts of campus and set off for the Alaskan wilderness. Their task: to study beaded streams, a natural phenomenon unique to the Arctic tundra. The expedition is part of the Integrating Geosciences and Engineering in the Arctic (IGEA) program run by Professor Colin Gleason, who designed the one-year course specifically to challenge students by exposing them to the rigors of real-world field research.</p2>

                        <p2>Liam Amery ’22 says, “I think that the most valuable learning moments came when things did not go to plan.” For example, “our original field measurement plan took much longer than we had anticipated, so we had to adapt on the fly.”</p2>
